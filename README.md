 Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree project

## Requirements:
Create a bookshelf app that allows the user to:
    1.  Search for and select books to be added to the BookCase
    2.  Categorize books as "read, currently reading, or want to read"
    3.  Place books on appropriate bookshelf
    4.  Move books between shelves
    5.  Remove books from the bookcase

## Future Enhancements:
    1.  Refactor ShelfPicker so that it accepts state rather than being hard-coded (DONE)
    2.  Add use case for when there are no books in the entire BookCase
    3.  Add message on AddBook page when the search returns zero results
    4.  Add message on AddBook page to indicate the number of books found
    5.  Add spinner while bookcase is loading
    6.  Add spinner while search is loading results
    7.  Optimize search engine - consider not searching until the user stops typing

## Getting Started
    1.  Clone the repository or download the files
    2.  From the command line:
    3.  Change to the project directory/folder
    4.  Install project dependencies using `npm install`
    5.  Start the development server using `npm start`

## User Instructions
- Once you run `npm start`, the server opens a browser window to the application home page.  
- Click on the down arrow on any book to open a menu from which you can change the shelf the book is on
- Click on the plus icon on the bottom right of the window to search for and add new books to your bookcase
